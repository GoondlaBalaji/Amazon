Example:
India’s e-commerce landscape, led by platforms like Amazon, is experiencing exponential growth, handling millions of product transactions across diverse regions and customer demographics. Yet, sales managers, inventory planners, and category analysts often lack a centralized, visual tool to compare product performance, track geographic sales trends, and monitor delivery effectiveness. This lack of visibility creates challenges in identifying high-performing regions and products, optimizing logistics, and making data-driven decisions in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving online retail market.

**Key Questions in Retail Sales Performance**

Which Indian states and cities drive the highest sales volume and successful deliveries?
→ Identify top-performing regions to target for future promotions or regional inventory optimization.

Which customer purchase patterns and fulfillment methods (Amazon vs. Merchant, Easy Ship vs. Expedited) are the most efficient?
→ Evaluate the effectiveness of fulfillment models and delivery options on customer satisfaction and speed.

Which product categories (e.g., Kurta, Dress, Set) and specific SKUs generate the most revenue?
→ Detect high-demand items to inform stock planning and product placement.

How do order statuses (Shipped, Delivered, Cancelled) impact overall performance metrics?
→ Pinpoint operational inefficiencies and reduce cancelled orders with better forecasting.

What are the monthly or seasonal trends in sales activity across different regions and categories?
→ Uncover peak seasons (festivals, sales events) and plan marketing or inventory accordingly.

…are difficult to answer quickly when dealing with raw transaction data.
